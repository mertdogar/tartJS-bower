tartJS
======

tartJS is a performance-focused JavaScript framework based on well-tested Google Closure Tools suite.
It provides rapid and responsive mobile app infrastructure.

Closure Compiler optimizes, checks and cleans up your annotated JavaScript code with best minification rates while helping you to catch errors.


## Getting Started

### Bower

Add tartJS to your project as a bower package:

```
    bower install tartJS-bower
```

### From scratch

Add tartJS to your project as a submodule:

```
    git submodule add git@github.com:tart/tartJS.git js/lib/tartJS
```

### Annotation

With help of Closure Compiler, class based inheritance and type safety is widely used in tartJS.
See [Annotating JavaScript for the Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler) how JSDoc annotation works.
